# Classical Mechanics

This repository contains my solutions to the exercises in Classical Mechanics, Third Edition, by Goldstein, Poole, & Safko. 
I have no degree or credentials whatsoever. I am not a student. It just seems like a fun way to pass the time. 
The whole thing will be done in LaTeX. I make no guarantees regarding the correctness of any of it. Enjoy.
