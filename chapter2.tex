\question
Complete the solution of the brachistochrone problem begun in section 2.2 and show that the desired curve is a cycloid with a cusp at the initial point at which the particle is released. Show also that if the particle is projected with an initial kinetic energy $\frac{1}{2} m v_0^2$ that the brachistochrone is still a cycloid through the two points with a cusp at a height $z$ above the initial point given by $v_0^2 = 2 g z$.
